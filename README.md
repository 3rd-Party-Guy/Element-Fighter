# Element-Fighter
This is a 1v1 brawler game. Each of the four characters has a unique element and abilities to compliment it.
Intended to be played with controllers.

# Technicals & Development History
Element-Fighter started - and ended - as a school project, with 4 weeks of development time.
There were two programmers on the team and two artists.
No 3rd-Party librariers were used in this project, just pure JavaScript.
Environment collision was implemented using a traiditional physics-engine that supports only primitive 2D cubes,
while combat collision was implemented with a novel, shader-based technique that allows for blazingly fast, pixel-perfect collisions.
